This is the source for my blog. Check out the first commit for a reasonably sane Jekyll template.

You can read about how I [escape Liquid tags in Jekyll](http://alexpearce.me/2012/04/escaping-liquid-tags-in-jekyll/), and how I chose to implement [category and tags index pages](http://alexpearce.me/2012/04/simple-jekyll-searching/).

Over time this blog should hold answers to any computer-related problems I run in to.
